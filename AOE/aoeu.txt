* How come we have a culture where you can't admit you have partial blame, you either have 100% blame or 0% blame so people end up a huge amount of time blaming each other,figuring out how to assign blame, and never admitting that someone did something wrong because he would have to get 100% blame for it
* How come we Americans have such over-inflated egos:  for example, the job ads for programmers are insane because the job ad people keep expanding the requirements because a lot of people exaggerate their abilities on their resumes...  Japanese don't seem to suffer from the Donald-Kruger effect
* How come us Westerners don't accept the fact that we may never know things exactly, and invent answers to questions which have no basis in evidence
* How come we are unable to see things from other people's sides, and have very poor listening skills
* How come we shamelessly talk about hurting other people, and put crimes in the spotlight
* How come we explain people/culture behavior by using free will almost exclusively, with very little enviromental information...
* How come we are all or nothing 
* How come we expect people to self-advocate for themselves...  this means that people who are good at marketing get ahead of people with actual skill
* How come we are encouraged to take what we want even if other people are hurt in the process - think about it if everyone wanted to do things that are bad for other people then it will lead to conflict, but if everyone
wanted to make other people happy then it wouldn't lead to conflict
